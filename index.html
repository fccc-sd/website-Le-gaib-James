        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p> Hi! I'm 16 year old Gaib Lust. I'm a very good baseball player with a special knack for drawing.
I have been playing baseball since I was 6 years old, I have just recently started pitching as well I had a 1.20 ERA.
In the league I played in I have the record for the most HBP. I was born in Toledo, Ohio in 2009 I moved to North Carolina for 2 Years when I Was 2.
Growing up my dad hasn't been involved in my life for the past 10 years, he's going to court soon for missing 10 years of child support payments. 
But if he fails to come up with the 10,000 dollars he owes he will be put in jail. Quite frankly I hate him I'm not gonna lie he's missed every important event 
in my life and hasn't once tried to contact me so I feel like the hate is permitted.
It'd be like if your boss excluded you out of everything important and tried to get you fired just based solely off the fact they dont like you.</p>

        <h3>My family</h3>
 <ul> 
<li>Graysyn</li>
<li>Geordan</li>
<li>Adrain</li>
<li>Emilee</li>
<li>Gaib (me)</li>
<p> I have 2 brothers and 1 sister that lives with my dad, my brothers names are Graysyn and Geordan (both 9 and 5).
Both of my brothers are going to school at Napoleon this will be Geo's first year of real school and he'll be going for the next 13 years 5 days a week for about 9 months give or take.
My sisters name is Baylee I haven't seen nor spoken to her in about 8 years? To be honest it's been so long I forgot how long it's been. To put it into persepctive I last saw her when she was 
a new born baby, she's now going into either 6th or 7th grade.
My mom's name is Emilee she had me when she was 18 (she's 35 now) things haven't always been the greatest for us but she worked as hard as she could to get out of the mud and we made it.
Then finally there's my step-dad Adrian he's a TPD officer and he has a K-9 named bearett. His K-9 is 4 years old and still acts like a puppy but he loves his job and loves biting to.</p> 

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p>
        Some of my hobbies are playing baseball, I play 1st base and I pitch. But I really like drawing as well, 
        but I like to draw long and hard drawings not the easy ones that take 20 seconds because then I feel like I didn't do anything.
        I also really like playing video games like, Fortnite and Rainbow Six Siege with my friends. 
        I've also been collecting signed and special memoribillia for as long as I can remember <em>I have multpile signed cards that are worth 3,000+ dollars. </em>









<conclusion>To conclude this document about me I just wanted to say thank you for your taking time out of your day to read this document, you're one of the best teachers I've had hands down. 
But that's besides the point, I'm going to leave you with a psychological to think about. Are things better or worse the second time around?</conclusion>
